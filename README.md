# Machine-Learning-Project-Smart-Crop-Recommendation-Based-on-Environment-
This project leverages machine learning to recommend suitable crops by analyzing soil characteristics (texture, nutrients, moisture, pH) and climatic data. By predicting soil quality, it provides crop suggestions that boost efficiency, increase yields, and minimize crop failure risks.
